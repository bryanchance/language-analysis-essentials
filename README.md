Language Analysis Essentials or LANES is a suite of open source Java modules for natural language processing and text mining. The toolkit includes modules for:

- measurement of content bearingness of terms.
- measurement of surface similarity of strings.
- parsing sentences and extracting keyterms.
- clustering of terms (with measurement of semantic relatedness of terms).
- determine the stability of word sequences.
- detecting classes of entities. the detection rate of this technique is about 95%, which outperforms state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary techniques such as Alchemy (73%), Illinois (13%), Stanford (13%) and Lexalytics (26%).
- mapping terms to Wikipedia concepts*.
- extraction of textual content from html pages*.
